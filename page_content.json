To maintain a high standard of quality and ensure a great experience for all users, we've established these guidelines for submitting your UI components. Adhering to these principles will help your work shine and make it more accessible and useful to the community. Please review them carefully before submitting your designs.",
    "keyAreasTitle": "Core Principles & Technical Standards",
    "keyAreas": [
      "**Clarity & Usability:** Components must be intuitive and easy to understand. Ensure clear visual hierarchy, logical interaction patterns, and provide necessary context for use.",
      "**Code Quality & Maintainability:** Submit clean, well-structured, and commented code. Follow best practices for your chosen language/framework (HTML, CSS, JS, React, etc.). Ensure your code is readable and easy for others to integrate.",
      "**Accessibility (A11y):** Designs must be accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA standards where applicable. Use semantic HTML, provide ARIA attributes, and ensure keyboard navigability and sufficient color contrast.",
      "**Performance:** Components should be optimized for performance. Avoid unnecessary animations, large asset files, or inefficient code that could slow down a user's application.",
      "**Visual Appeal & Consistency:** While creativity is encouraged, components should exhibit a good sense of aesthetics and align with modern UI/UX trends. If part of a set, ensure visual consistency.",
      "**Responsiveness:** Components must be responsive and adapt gracefully to different screen sizes and devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).",
      "**Originality & Licensing:** Submit your own original work or ensure you have the right to share any assets used. Clearly state any licensing terms if applicable for premium components.",
      "**Documentation & Preview:** Provide a clear description of your component, its features, and how to use it. Your code snippets should be functional and produce a reasonable preview of the component in action.",
      "**No Malicious Code:** Submissions must not contain any malicious code, trackers (beyond basic analytics if declared), or harmful scripts.",
      "**Respectful Content:** Ensure your component, its description, and any associated text are respectful and inclusive. No offensive or discriminatory content will be tolerated."
